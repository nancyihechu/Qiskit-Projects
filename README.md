# Qiskit Quantum Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing various quantum computing experiments and projects using **Qiskit**. In this repository, you'll find a combination of **Jupyter Notebooks**, **PDFs** of quantum math assignments, and **Quantum Composer** solutions. The primary focus of these projects is on quantum circuits, quantum algorithms, and running simulations on real quantum devices using IBM's quantum computing platform.

## What’s Inside:

1. **Introduction to Qiskit** (Jupyter Notebook)
   - This notebook provides a basic introduction to **Qiskit**, walking through creating quantum circuits, applying quantum gates, and running simulations. It includes code for simple circuits such as creating a quantum entanglement and performing measurements on qubits.

2. **Quantum Math & Quantum Composer Assignments** (PDFs)
   - These PDFs contain the solutions to **Quantum Math** problems and **Quantum Composer** assignments, which explore topics such as quantum states, quantum gates, and quantum circuit simulation. These assignments were completed as part of a course/module on quantum computing.

3. **Qiskit Projects and Simulations** (Python Scripts)
   - This section includes Python scripts for quantum simulations such as building and running simple quantum circuits on IBM Quantum devices, applying quantum gates, and observing the measurement results.

## Getting Started

To run the **Jupyter Notebook** and experiment with quantum circuits:
1. Install **Qiskit** by following the instructions at [Qiskit Install Guide](https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html).
2. Open the **Introduction to Qiskit** notebook in Jupyter, and run through the examples provided. You can modify the circuits and try your own quantum operations.
3. The PDFs are available for reference; feel free to review the solutions to deepen your understanding of quantum math and quantum computing concepts.
